#### Video Demo
[here](https://youtu.be/oLVeEoCN3gY)

### Description
This playful project demonstrates object creation in the DOM via JavaScript, DOM object manipulation, using Math random functions, perfect and imperfect collision physics, and gravity. Also uses Google Font CDN for a nice font. Enjoy the chaos of the balls bouncing around the screen. Click to watch them drop.

### How to Run
Currently is not built to be hosted. Simply open the index.html file locally with your browser or check out the [demo](https://maxohsawa.github.io/ball-pit).

### Roadmap of Future Improvements
Potentially may add more animations and modes. May incorporate into portfolio landing page.
